This is a simple photo gallery that should eventually be able to operate using just files on any file storage, either locally or in cloud storage.

The whole thing is in its early days of development so there's not much to see here.

The app uses Typescript, React, React-router and Styled components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts that are provided by create-react-app, which was used to bootstrap this project.:

### `yarn web-start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn web-test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn web-build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
